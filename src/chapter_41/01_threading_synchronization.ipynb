    "- **`Lock`**: Mutual exclusion -- only one thread can hold the lock at a time\n",

    "- **`Event`**: Simple signaling mechanism between threads\n",
    "- **`Semaphore`**: Limits the number of threads accessing a resource concurrently\n",
    "- **`Barrier`**: Synchronization point where a fixed number of threads must arrive before any proceed\n",

    "### Synchronization Primitives\n",
    "- **`Lock`**: Use `with lock:` to protect critical sections; only one thread enters at a time\n",
    "- **`RLock`**: Reentrant lock that the same thread can acquire multiple times without deadlock\n",
    "- **`Event`**: Call `event.set()` to wake threads waiting on `event.wait()`\n",
    "- **`Semaphore(n)`**: Allows up to `n` threads to hold the semaphore concurrently\n",
    "- **`Barrier(n)`**: Blocks each thread at `barrier.wait()` until all `n` threads have arrived\n",
    "- **`Condition`**: Combines a lock with `wait()` / `notify()` for complex coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- Always use the `with` statement for locks and semaphores to guarantee release\n",
    "- Prefer `RLock` when methods that hold a lock call other methods needing the same lock\n",
    "- Use `Event` for simple one-time or resettable signals; use `Condition` for complex predicates\n",
    "- `BoundedSemaphore` prevents accidental over-releasing\n",
    "- Keep critical sections as short as possible to minimize contention"
