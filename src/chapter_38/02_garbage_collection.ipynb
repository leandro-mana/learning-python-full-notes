    "This notebook covers Python's garbage collector (`gc` module), which supplements reference counting by detecting and cleaning up circular references. You will also learn about `weakref.finalize` for cleanup callbacks and `gc.freeze` for performance optimization.\n",

    "- **`gc` module**: Controls the cyclic garbage collector\n",
    "- **Circular references**: Objects that reference each other, preventing ref count from reaching zero\n",
    "- **Generational collection**: Three generations with increasing collection thresholds\n",
    "- **`weakref.finalize`**: Register a callback that runs when an object is collected\n",
    "- **`gc.freeze` / `gc.unfreeze`**: Move objects to a permanent generation for performance"

    "### `gc` Module Essentials\n",
    "- **`gc.isenabled()`**: Check if the garbage collector is active (default: `True`)\n",
    "- **`gc.collect()`**: Manually trigger collection; returns the count of freed objects\n",
    "- **`gc.get_stats()`**: Returns a list of 3 dicts (one per generation) with `collections`, `collected`, and `uncollectable` keys\n",
    "- **`gc.get_threshold()`**: Shows allocation thresholds that trigger automatic collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circular References\n",
    "- Reference counting cannot break cycles (A references B, B references A)\n",
    "- The garbage collector detects and frees cycles automatically\n",
    "- Use `weakref.ref` to verify that objects have been collected\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleanup Callbacks\n",
    "- **`__del__`**: Called on object destruction, but can prevent cycle collection\n",
    "- **`weakref.finalize`**: Preferred alternative; does not interfere with the GC\n",

    "### Performance: `gc.freeze` / `gc.unfreeze`\n",

    "- `gc.get_freeze_count()` reports how many objects are frozen\n",
