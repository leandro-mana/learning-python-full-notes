# Chapter 25: Python Ecosystem and Best Practices

## Topics Covered
- Code style: PEP 8, naming conventions, code organization
- Documentation: docstrings, PEP 257, Sphinx basics
- Linting and formatting: ruff, black, flake8, isort
- Testing best practices: pytest patterns, fixtures, parametrize
- CI/CD pipelines: GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks
- Project organization: monorepo vs multi-repo, src-layout
- Dependency management: pinning, lock files, security updates
- Python version management and compatibility

## Notebooks
1. **01_code_style_and_docs.ipynb** — PEP 8, naming conventions, docstrings, documentation
2. **02_linting_and_testing.ipynb** — Ruff, formatters, pytest patterns, parametrize
3. **03_cicd_and_project_org.ipynb** — GitHub Actions, pre-commit, project structure, workflows

## Key Takeaways
- Consistent code style reduces cognitive overhead
- Automated linting catches issues before review
- pytest fixtures and parametrize reduce test boilerplate
